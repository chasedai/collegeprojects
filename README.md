A simple php website talking to MySQL database based on Wordpress.<br>
Basically any non-wordpress php files were created by me. <br>

for example: <br>

admin_login.php<br>
changeInfo.php<br>
changestaffinfo.php<br>
lalala.php<br>
login.php<br>
newOrder.php<br>
planChoose.php<br>
register.php<br>
staff-login.php<br>
test.php<br>
...

There are other files in plugin and theme as well.
